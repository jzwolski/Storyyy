My cousin after ingesting a purple crayon!)\n\nAudio frequency ranges between people went completely crazy that many people could\nhardly hear each other anymore...\n\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center'}\nt=c(1:100)\nx = t*cos(t)\ny = t*sin(t)\nqplot(x,y,xlab=\"Average frequency of right ear (Hz)\", ylab = \"Average frequency of left ear (Hz)\", geom=\"point\", main = \"Hearing Ranges:\\n Random sampling of 100 people\")+geom_path(colour = \"green\")+theme_bw(base_size=16)\n```\n\n<img src=\"Pictures/lolcat.jpg\" height=\"\"480\" width=\"620\">\n\nThere was a drastic change in human height, which gave statistics professors nightmares. The data just did not make any sense, as human variability in height became so random:\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.width=8,fig.height=6}\nx = c(1:100)\ny = seq(1, 1000, 10)\nqplot(x, y, geom=\"bar\", xlab =\"Person\", ylab =\"Height (ft)\", main = \"Utter Abnormality:\\n Random sampling of 100 people\", stat=\"identity\", fill=as.factor(x)) + theme(legend.position = \"none\")+theme_bw(base_size=16)\n```\n\n\n\nWith people randomly between 1 to 1,000 feet tall, the real-estate business slumped into a chatoic terror:\n\n<img src=\"Pictures/building1.jpg\" height=\"\"480\" width=\"620\">\n\n<img src=\"Pictures/building2.jpg\" height=\"\"480\" width=\"620\">\n\n\nForeclosures went through the roof, and banks were hit extremely hard, as stocks took a complete nosedive. A depression was imminent, and the public became more and more distressed with the bigwigs in the nation's capital.\n\nMetabolism of living beings was totally altered. The curve of birth and death started to change, and overall population inicreased to 10 billion in 5 years. Aging is even faster than before, which led the population pyramid to be left skewed: 50 percent of people on the earth are over 80 years old.\n\n\nHowever, it turns out that this chaos was created by the object Pluto:\n\n<img src=\"http://thumbpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Funniest-Government-Shutdown-Memes-%E2%80%94-3.jpg\" height=\"350\" width=\"500\">\n\nOnce every nation on Earth recognized Pluto as a planet, everything changed, and the Earth somehow escaped from the blackhole.\n\nTo be continued...\n\n",
