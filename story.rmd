What would the world be like if the Normal Curve <br> 
had never been discovered?

I'm not sure.

1. The plot of normal curve
```{r}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
hx <- dnorm(x)

degf <- c(1, 3, 8, 30)
colors <- c("red", "blue", "darkgreen", "gold", "black")
labels <- c("df=1", "df=3", "df=8", "df=30", "normal")

plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="Comparison of t Distributions")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
