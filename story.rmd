One day, the Earth ventured a wee-bit too close to a blackhole, and all
the normalness it once enjoyed was sucked away forever.

One day, while Carl Friedrich Gauss was about to make a historic discovery, the Earth ventured a wee-bit too close to a blackhole, and all knowledge in the world was suddenly distorted.

This left the world a mess, as though its blueprint came from a two-year old wielding a purple crayon: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)
logic <- runif(60, 1, 100)
sanity <- runif(60, 1, 100)
qplot(logic, sanity, geom="path", xlab = "Logic", ylab = "Sanity", main="The World - By Tiny Tim") + theme(legend.position = "none")+geom_path(colour = "purple")+
  theme_bw(base_size=16)
```

Intelligent designer of the new and abnormal planet Earth (on right).  
(aka. My cousin after ingesting a purple crayon!)

Variables that once followed a normal curve now followed an abnormal spiral into doom!
For instance, audio frequency ranges between people were now so un-normalized that
many people could hardly hear each other anymore...

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
t=c(1:100)
x = t*cos(t)
y = t*sin(t)
qplot(x,y,xlab="Average frequency of right ear (Hz)", ylab = "Average frequency of left ear (Hz)", geom="point", main = "Hearing Ranges:\n Random sampling of 100 people")+geom_path(colour = "green")+theme_bw(base_size=16)
```

Statistics professors were mortified because they could no longer organize human height
as a normal distribution - a textbook example for many years. Instead, human variability
of height was so random, it seemed that everyone's height was abnormal nowadays: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.width=8,fig.height=6}
x = c(1:100)
y = seq(1, 1000, 10)
qplot(x, y, geom="bar", xlab ="Person", ylab ="Height (ft)", main = "Utter Abnormality:\n Random sampling of 100 people", stat="identity", fill=as.factor(x)) + theme(legend.position = "none")+theme_bw(base_size=16)
```

With people randomly between 1 to 1,000 feet tall, the real-estate business slumped into a chatoic terror:

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
y <- dnorm(x)
df<-data.frame(x,y)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df,aes(x, y))+geom_line(size=0.5)+ylab("Density")+xlab("Value")+
  labs(title="Normal Curve")+theme_bw(base_size=16)
