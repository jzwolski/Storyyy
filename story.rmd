One day, the Earth ventured a wee-bit too close to a blackhole, and all
the normalness it once enjoyed was sucked away forever.

This left the world a scribbled, chicken-scratch mess, as though its blueprint
came from a two-year old wielding a purple crayon: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
logic <- runif(60, 1, 100)
sanity <- runif(60, 1, 100)
qplot(logic, sanity, geom="path", xlab = "Logic", ylab = "Sanity", main="The World - By Tiny Tim") + theme(legend.position = "none")+geom_path(colour = "purple") 
```

Intelligent designer of the new and abnormal world (on right).

Variables that had followed a normal curve now folled an abnormal spiral into doom!
For instance, audio frequency ranges between people were now so un-normalized that
many people could hardly hear each other anymore...

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
t=c(1:100)
x = t*cos(t)
y = t*sin(t)
qplot(x,y,xlab="Average frequency of right ear (Hz)", ylab = "Average frequency of left ear (Hz)", geom="point", main = "Hearing Ranges:\n Random sampling of 100 people")+geom_path(colour = "green") 
```

1. The plot of a normal curve
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
x <- seq(-4, 4, length=100)
hx <- dnorm(x)
plot(x, hx, type="l", lty=2, xlab="x value",
  ylab="Density", main="The plot of a Normal Curve")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
